Comparaison and full visualization of two blocks 'Block A' and 'Block B' referred to as 'Tour A' and 'Tour B' or TOUR_A and TOUR_B in dataset.

Read the csv files provided in the dataset. and read the pdf file for more information about the dataset. and finally read Data_Tree.md to know what the full dataset contains.

You are only given two months of data, spanning from January to February 2025, but note that there's more data available in the original dataset, spanning from September 2023 to April 2025. with each month is a folder containing 15 csv files, each is 2 days of data.

what you need to do is to create a comprehensive notebook or python script that performs the following tasks:
- Load the data from the provided CSV files using a dynamic approach that can handle multiple files and folders.
- Extract relevant features from the dataset for analysis (only data relevant to blocks A and B).
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing values, inconsistencies, or errors.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data for both blocks.
- Create visualizations to compare the performance and characteristics of Block A and Block B.
- Summarize findings and insights from the analysis.
- Make a comprehensive and multiple visualizations to represent the comparison between the two blocks.
- Most importantly, we need power consumption analysis between the two blocks, identifying which block is more efficient in terms of energy usage.

Ensure that your code is well-documented, with comments explaining each step of the process. Use libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and any other libraries you find necessary for your analysis.
